# MovieDemo-WebApp
Entry level web app that has an interesting dynamic Interface

Thats my first project in my .net backend course.
it is an idea like imdb but on very small scale, that it has only the page of top 10 rated movies through history and it is responsive and dynamic
i tried to makr it look very friendly.
